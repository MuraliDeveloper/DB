Hibernate is a open source framework.
Framework: extrenal library that contains the prewritten code for 
the solutions for most of the common problms in the project.
Hibernate is available in the form of jar files.
In a java project we need to import the hibernate jar files.
  
  
Advantages :
- Hibernate is ORM frameowork.
  ORM : Object(JAVA) Relational(DATABASE) Mapping.
  For every table there is a java class.
  
  database:  
  Table : Visitor
  table columns: id, name,city, salary
  row : contains data
  
  java:
  class: Visitor
  instance variables: id, name,city, salary
  object : contains data
  
- save : object is converted to row
  read : row are converted to java objects.
    
-ex: 
if(rs.next()){
					//get columns for every row
					int id = rs.getInt("c_id");
					String name = rs.getString("c_name");
          String city = rs.getString("city");
					int salary = rs.getInt("salary");
					System.out.println(id +", " + name +", "+salary);
				}  

- convert row to java obj(mapping logic) in jdbc developer has to take care. write 60 lines 
- convert row to java obj(mapping logic) in hibernate, the framewrok will to take care , write 1 line of code.
  
-change the table name/change column name/add new column/rename column:
in jdbc: the impact is huge 
in hibernate : the change is only in on place.
  
-migrating the database . ex: oracle to mysql
in jdbc the change is very complex.
in hibernate the change is required in a single place. ex:change the dialect property in hiberante.xml   
  
  
- reusability, modularity , avoid code repetition , lossely coupled, faster development.
- Hibernate has its own query language, i.e hibernate query language which is database independent.
- schema generation/table generationm cna be automatically using hibernate.
-Hibernate supports relationships like One-To-Many,One-To-One, Many-To-Many-to-Many, Many-To-One.
- Hibernate supports Inheritance, Associations, Collections
- In jdbc all exceptions are checked exceptions,  in hiberante we have Un-checked exceptions, so no need to take care of exception handling.
- In hibernate most of the cases developer doesnt not need to write the SQL queries,
the queries are auto generated by hiberante.
- Hibernate supports caching mechanism , performance is improved + load on the db is reduced.
- pagination implementation is simplified.
- Lazy-Loading : The lazy-loading concept fetches only the necessary object that is required for the execution of an application.
